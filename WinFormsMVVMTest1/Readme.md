# Project Title

A simple program to illustrate some of the features of the Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm in a WinForms application

## Description

As I could not find a WinForms sample for the Mvvm toolkit I wrote this simple program to show some of its features.

The program creates a form that uses a PersonVM (Person ViewModel) to show and update a Person object using the toolkit.
